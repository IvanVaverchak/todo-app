The React To-Do App is built with modern tools and frameworks, ensuring a robust and efficient development process.

**Frontend Technologies:**

**React:**

The app is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture facilitates modular and reusable code.

**TypeScript:**

TypeScript is utilized to bring static typing to the application, enhancing code reliability and developer productivity.

**State Management:**

**useState and useEffect Hooks:**

React's useState and useEffect hooks are leveraged for managing local component state and handling side effects, such as data fetching.
